# Machine_Learning

A curated collection of my machine learning projects, showcasing hands-on experience with supervised and unsupervised learning, data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and real-world problem solving using tools like Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib.  

This portfolio reflects my journey in applying ML to real datasets, building intelligent systems, and continually improving through experimentation and learning.  

Projects include predictive modeling, classification tasks, regression analysis, and exploratory data analysis (EDA), all documented with clean code, visualizations, and insights.
